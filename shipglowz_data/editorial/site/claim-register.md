# Claim Register

| Claim area | Allowed posture | Evidence source | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| AI automation | Describe implemented workflows and reviewed specs only | `shipglowz_data/product/site/product.md`, ready specs, verified code | needs proof per claim | Do not promise autonomous publishing without product evidence. |
| Time savings or growth outcomes | Use cautious benefit language | `shipglowz_data/gtm/site/gtm.md`, user evidence, analytics when available | needs proof | Avoid quantified gains unless validated. |
| Security and privacy | State only verified handling | `privacy` page source, backend/app contracts, legal review | needs proof | Do not imply certifications or compliance not documented. |
| Availability or reliability | Avoid uptime promises | deployment proof and runtime monitoring | needs proof | Use operational status only when measured. |
| Degraded mode and resilience | Allow bounded recovery messaging only | app + lab canonical docs, verified product behavior | needs proof | Allowed claim: authenticated app access, cached reads where supported, local queue for supported actions, automatic replay. |
| Pricing or offers | Match current GTM/pricing source | `shipglowz_data/gtm/site/gtm.md`, pricing spec if present | needs proof | No public pricing claim without a current offer contract. |
| Localized French copy | Preserve claim meaning, not just translated wording | source EN copy + canonical business/product docs | needs proof | No stronger promise in `fr/*` than in default locale. |
