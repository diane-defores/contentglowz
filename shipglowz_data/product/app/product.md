# Product Context — app

## Position
`app` is the authenticated Flutter execution layer of the ContentGlowz ecosystem. It is the operator-facing app that turns source inputs (ideas, project context, personas, rituals, media assets) into ready-made publishable output with optional edits while tolerating API instability.

## What this product does now
- provides authenticated onboarding and workspace bootstrap via Clerk + FastAPI session flow;
- supports multi-project workspace management with an explicit active-project selection model;
- runs content workflows (feed, ideas, angles, editor, personas, scheduling, drip plans, affiliation/content domains);
- exposes `Project Intelligence V1` for project-scoped source ingestion, recommendations, and Idea Pool conversion;
- exposes `Video Timeline V1` for backend-orchestrated preview/final render preparation from existing content items;
- exposes a pre-generation source library where creators can add image, video, audio, text and public-link sources, resolve individual failures, and deliberately choose between saving `Sources prêtes` or starting `Générer la vidéo`;
- prepares video-compatible feed items ahead of swipe time through durable branded-video generation runs with feed-facing readiness states (`ready_to_publish`, `preparing`, `needs_review`, `blocked`, `failed`) and compact publish-preflight summaries on the card;
- captures local Android screenshots and screen recordings for creator reference assets;
- supports production-adjacent resilience through degraded mode (cached reads + queued writes + replay + sync state)
- exposes diagnostics and observability (`/uptime`, `/performance`, `/analytics`, `/activity`) so operators understand backend and queue health;
- supports feedback capture (text/audio) and admin review for support triage.

## Core user journey
1. user signs in through Clerk web auth pages and lands on `/entry`;
2. bootstrap checks evaluate auth, API availability, and workspace state;
3. user either completes onboarding, resumes from cached state, or navigates to a project/workflow screen;
4. workflow actions are executed against FastAPI and reflected in the app shell;
5. if API is unavailable, supported actions are queued and replayed when connectivity returns.

## Product boundaries (what is currently documented and delivered)
- **In scope:** AI-first content assembly, optional edit, feed-native publish preflight, truthful publish flows, project configuration, content status, offline continuity, and workflow surfaces.
- **Project Intelligence V1 scope:** active-project intelligence status, source management, evidence ingestion, recommendations, and Idea Pool conversion, with backend constraints on upload types and sizes.
- **Video Timeline V1 scope:** timeline editing plus preview/final render orchestration through backend contracts, without direct Flutter-to-worker calls.
- **Video Source Intake V1 scope:** collecting and validating project-scoped sources, saving an exact ready revision, and optionally handing that revision to generation. Video generation execution, editing, rendering and publication remain separate stages.
- **Ahead-of-time branded video scope:** the feed can request safe refreshes of branded-video candidates, consume compact readiness states, surface preflight blockers directly on the card, and keep the video editor as an explicit optional branch instead of the default path.
- **Android-only V1 scope:** local device screenshot and screen-recording capture with Android consent, app-scoped storage, preview, discard, and share/export.
- **Partially in scope / not finished:** end-to-end external publish execution by channel.
  - Route and UX for publish actions exists in some paths, but full channel-account linking and feedback loop are not fully closed yet.
- **Explicitly out of scope in this repo:** marketing site, public SEO/landing content, pricing mechanics, and full AI orchestration decisions (owned by surrounding repos and services).

## Proven functional domains
- Entry and access control (`/entry`, `/auth`, `/onboarding`, route guards).
- Structured workflows: `Projects`, `Feed`, `Editor`, `Persona`, `Ideas`, `Angles`, `Drip`, `Research`, `Ritual`.
- Operational domains: `Affiliations`, `SEO`, `Runs`, `Newsletter`, `Templates`, `Content Tools`, `Calendar`, `History`, `Activity`.
- Settings and integrations surfaces (`/settings`, `/settings/integrations`).

## Non-goals (explicitly maintained)
- Not positioned as a blind autopilot that publishes opaque outputs without user visibility or control.
- Not responsible for marketing pages or external campaign channel management.
- Not a native-auth-first mobile rewrite yet (web auth path is the active production path in this repo).
- Not a cloud screen-recording asset library yet; capture uploads, retention, and sync need a separate backend spec.

## Business-facing constraints to keep synchronized
- The app depends on consistent workspace/project semantics from backend contracts.
- Any change to onboarding, feed publish semantics, video readiness states, or offline coverage changes this product promise and must trigger docs updates for user-facing claims.
