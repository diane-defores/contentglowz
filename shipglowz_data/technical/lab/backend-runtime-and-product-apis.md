# Backend Runtime and Product APIs

## Purpose

Preserve the durable backend contracts that were previously documented in `lab/README.md` before local docs were reduced to compatibility facades.

## Owned Files

- `api/routers/`
- `api/services/`
- `api/migrations/`
- `scheduler/`
- `status/`
- `agents/`

## Entrypoints

- `doppler run -- uvicorn api.main:app --reload --port 8000`
- `curl http://localhost:8000/health`
- Swagger: `http://localhost:8000/docs`
- Redoc: `http://localhost:8000/redoc`

## Runtime Notes

- `api/main.py` owns startup/shutdown lifecycle hooks and background scheduler initialization.
- Sentry initializes at API import time when `SENTRY_DSN` is set.
- `SENTRY_SEND_DEFAULT_PII` defaults to `false`.
- `SENTRY_TRACES_SAMPLE_RATE` defaults to `0.0`.
- `/health` exposes only redacted Sentry status: configured state, environment, release, and dist.
- CORS and authentication middleware are configured for Flutter, site, and dashboard clients.
- `ecosystem.config.cjs` describes the documented manual runtime setup; the hosted deployment provider is intentionally not asserted here.

## Production API Domain Migration

The public API should resolve to `https://api.contentglowz.com`. `https://api.winflowz.com` may remain a temporary alias during DNS/client migration.

Migration checklist:

- Point DNS for `api.contentglowz.com` to the server currently serving the Lab API.
- Keep Clerk validation aligned in production secrets:
  - `CLERK_JWT_ISSUER`
  - `CLERK_JWKS_URL`
  - optional aliases only if used: `CLERK_ISSUER`, `CLERK_AUDIENCE`, `CLERK_JWT_AUDIENCE`
- Keep the legacy API alias until all clients are rebuilt.
- Rebuild/redeploy clients with `API_BASE_URL=https://api.contentglowz.com`.
- Verify `curl -i https://api.contentglowz.com/health` returns FastAPI health JSON, not a Vercel `DEPLOYMENT_NOT_FOUND` response.

PM2 and live server mutation remain operator-only.

## Google Search Console OAuth

Required environment variables:

- `GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID`
- `GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET`
- `GOOGLE_OAUTH_REDIRECT_URI` optional override; router callback URL is the fallback

Operational rules:

- Enable Google Search Console API in the Google Cloud project.
- Configure OAuth consent screen and callback at `/api/search-console/oauth/callback`.
- Search Console tokens are encrypted at rest.
- Search Console tokens must never be returned by API responses.

## Project Intelligence V1

Project Intelligence is project-scoped memory and recommendation infrastructure.

Routes:

- `GET /api/projects/{project_id}/intelligence/status`
- `POST /api/projects/{project_id}/intelligence/upload`
- `POST /api/projects/{project_id}/intelligence/sync`
- `GET /api/projects/{project_id}/intelligence/jobs`
- `GET /api/projects/{project_id}/intelligence/sources`
- `DELETE /api/projects/{project_id}/intelligence/sources/{source_id}`
- `GET /api/projects/{project_id}/intelligence/documents`
- `GET /api/projects/{project_id}/intelligence/facts`
- `GET /api/projects/{project_id}/intelligence/recommendations`
- `GET /api/projects/{project_id}/intelligence/provider-readiness`
- `POST /api/projects/{project_id}/intelligence/recommendations/{recommendation_id}/idea-pool`

V1 ingestion constraints:

- max 10 files per upload job
- max 10 MB per file
- text-like formats only: `text/plain`, `text/markdown`, `text/csv`, `application/json`, `text/html`, and markdown-like extensions
- one active ingestion/sync job per `userId + projectId`

Operational behavior:

- Deterministic cleaning, chunking, dedupe, and fact extraction work without AI credentials.
- Optional AI synthesis preflight routes through `ai_runtime_service`; intelligence routes/services must not read provider env directly.
- Source removal excludes derived evidence from reads and recommendation/Idea Pool actions.
- Startup ensures intelligence tables via `project_intelligence_store.ensure_tables()` when Turso is configured.
- Provider readiness is advisory metadata only. V1 does not auto fine-tune or deploy providers.

## Unified Project Asset Library

Project assets are backend-owned, project-scoped inventory for editor and generation workflows. This is not a public DAM, marketplace, arbitrary URL importer, or free provider playground.

Current backend routes live under `/api/projects/{project_id}/assets`:

- `GET /` lists owned project assets with filters for `media_kind`, `source`, `include_tombstoned`, `limit`, and `offset`.
- `GET /{asset_id}` returns one owned asset with a client-safe `storage_descriptor`; raw `storage_uri` is not returned as client authority.
- `GET /{asset_id}/usage` returns active usage links.
- `GET /{asset_id}/events` returns the asset audit/history stream.
- `POST /{asset_id}/eligibility` checks whether a guided action can use an asset without mutating usage state.
- `POST /{asset_id}/select` creates a usage link after server-side asset and target ownership validation.
- `POST /{asset_id}/primary` creates a primary usage link and clears previous primary state for the same target and placement.
- `POST /clear-primary` clears primary state for a target and placement.
- `POST /{asset_id}/preview-refresh` returns a refreshed safe descriptor; it does not sign or upload binaries.
- `POST /{asset_id}/tombstone` blocks future reuse while preserving history.
- `POST /{asset_id}/restore` restores a tombstoned asset within the retained metadata window.
- `GET /cleanup-report` reports tombstones eligible for cleanup, degraded assets, and active assets missing storage metadata. Physical deletion is not enabled by default.

Security and retention rules:

- Every route requires Clerk auth and project ownership.
- Asset selection validates both the asset and target server-side before mutation; Flutter state is not a permission boundary.
- `local_only`, degraded, tombstoned, stale, foreign, provider-temporary, or incompatible assets cannot be selected for publish, render, or reference actions.
- Tombstoned assets keep readable provenance for the 30-day history window and are hidden from default list calls.
- Storage descriptors redact signed query tokens and provider URLs.
- Bunny upload, delete, and signing remain owned by upload or media-generation features.

## Video Timeline and Remotion Rendering

The canonical video timeline lives in `lab`, not in Remotion or Flutter. The backend owns validation, immutable versions, asset eligibility, preview/final job gates, and signed artifact URLs. Remotion is an internal renderer adapter behind `worker`.

Timeline API routes live under `/api/video-timelines`:

- `POST /from-content` creates or loads the active timeline for an owned content item.
- `GET /{timeline_id}` returns the draft, latest version, and preview/final state.
- `PATCH /{timeline_id}/draft` saves a mutable draft with optimistic revision checks.
- `POST /{timeline_id}/versions` validates the draft, resolves render-safe assets, stores immutable renderer props, and records `video_version` asset usages.
- `POST /{timeline_id}/versions/{version_id}/preview` creates a preview job for the exact current version.
- `POST /{timeline_id}/versions/{version_id}/preview/{preview_job_id}/approve` approves a completed non-stale preview.
- `POST /{timeline_id}/versions/{version_id}/render-final` creates a final job only from the approved preview for that version.
- `GET /{timeline_id}/jobs/{job_id}` refreshes status and returns a short-lived signed artifact URL when completed.

Operational requirements:

- Turso/libSQL schema includes `api/migrations/005_video_timelines.sql`.
- Startup also ensures timeline tables and indexes idempotently.
- Required render env vars follow the worker contract:
  - `REMOTION_WORKER_URL`
  - `REMOTION_WORKER_TOKEN`
  - `CONTENTGLOWZ_RENDER_DIR`
  - `RENDER_ARTIFACT_SIGNING_KEY`
- `BUNNY_CDN_HOSTNAME` is required when timeline assets are stored as `bunny://` URIs.
- Durable Bunny HTTP URLs are normalized without query strings before being sent to Remotion props.
- Provider-temporary, local-only, tombstoned, degraded, missing, foreign, or incompatible assets are rejected before version creation.
- Final render is blocked until the exact version has an approved completed preview.

## AI Asset Understanding Guardrails

Asset understanding/tagging is asynchronous and suggestion-only. It helps users find media; it does not auto-publish, auto-clear rights, or replace editor decisions.

Provider rules:

- BYOK is resolved first from the user credential store.
- Optional platform fallback may use `GEMINI_API_KEY` or `OPENAI_API_KEY` when enabled.
- If no credential is available, jobs return `provider_not_configured` and assets stay usable without AI tags.
- `ffprobe` and `ffmpeg` should be available on workers for deterministic media inspection.

Default guardrails, environment-overridable:

- `ASSET_UNDERSTANDING_MAX_IMAGE_BYTES`: 25 MB
- `ASSET_UNDERSTANDING_MAX_SOURCE_VIDEO_BYTES`: 500 MB
- `ASSET_UNDERSTANDING_MAX_SOURCE_VIDEO_SECONDS`: 1800 seconds
- `ASSET_UNDERSTANDING_MAX_PROVIDER_VIDEO_SECONDS`: 90 seconds
- `ASSET_UNDERSTANDING_MAX_PROVIDER_FRAMES`: 180
- `ASSET_UNDERSTANDING_MAX_AUDIO_SECONDS`: 120 seconds
- `ASSET_UNDERSTANDING_CONCURRENCY_PER_PROJECT`: 2
- `ASSET_UNDERSTANDING_CONCURRENCY_PER_USER`: 4
- `ASSET_UNDERSTANDING_DAILY_PLATFORM_QUOTA_IMAGES`: 100
- `ASSET_UNDERSTANDING_DAILY_PLATFORM_QUOTA_VIDEOS`: 25
- `ASSET_UNDERSTANDING_DAILY_BYOK_QUOTA_IMAGES`: 250
- `ASSET_UNDERSTANDING_DAILY_BYOK_QUOTA_VIDEOS`: 50

Privacy, retention, and attribution:

- Treat software-demo media as potentially sensitive because it may contain PII, tokens, or customer UI.
- Keep durable metadata minimal.
- Avoid storing raw OCR dumps, full transcripts, and provider raw payloads as user-facing truth.
- Preserve attribution for external/social assets via source attribution, creator URL, and credit text.
- Unknown rights must surface warnings.
- AI tags are suggestions until user acceptance.
- Low-confidence tags should not dominate recommendations.

## Image Robot AI Generation

Image Robot supports guided AI image generation through Black Forest Labs FLUX without adding a free-form playground. The entrypoint remains the existing profile workflow.

Routes and behavior:

- `POST /api/images/generate-from-profile` accepts `image_provider=flux` via a system or custom profile and queues async generation.
- Built-in Flux profiles cover blog hero, article section, social card, and thumbnail placements.
- `GET /api/images/generations?project_id=...` lists durable AI generation history.
- `GET /api/images/generations/{id}` returns one generation record.
- `GET /api/images/references`, `POST /api/images/references`, `PATCH /api/images/references`, and `DELETE /api/images/references` manage approved project visual references.
- Flux receives only same-project approved references, capped at 8.
- Successful Flux outputs are downloaded from BFL temporary signed result URLs, uploaded to Bunny CDN, persisted in `ImageGeneration`, and registered as project assets with source `image_robot`.

Required environment:

- `BFL_API_KEY`
- optional `BFL_IMAGE_MODEL`, default `flux-2-pro`
- optional `BFL_API_BASE_URL`, default `https://api.bfl.ai/v1`
- optional `BFL_SAFETY_TOLERANCE`, default `2`, server-side only

Startup ensures `ImageGeneration` and `ImageReference` tables when Turso is configured. If FLUX or Turso is not configured, the API returns an explicit error instead of falling back to Robolly/OpenAI.

## Project Selection Contract

- Active project selection for a signed-in user is persisted in `UserSettings.projectSelectionMode` and `UserSettings.defaultProjectId`.
- `projectSelectionMode` supports `auto`, `selected`, and `none`.
- `GET /api/me` and `GET /api/bootstrap` resolve project context from that pair.
- `none` returns no default project.
- `selected` uses only the explicit `defaultProjectId` if it is still active.
- `auto` uses the explicit default first, then falls back to the first active project.
- `Project.isDefault` may still exist in stored rows for backward compatibility, but it is no longer the source of truth for Flutter routing.
- Project create/update payloads now use canonical `source_url`; legacy `github_url` and `url` aliases remain accepted.

Supported project routes used by the app:

- `GET /api/projects`
- `POST /api/projects`
- `GET /api/projects/{id}`
- `PATCH /api/projects/{id}`
- `POST /api/projects/{id}/archive`
- `POST /api/projects/{id}/unarchive`
- `DELETE /api/projects/{id}`
- `POST /api/projects/onboard`
- `POST /api/projects/{id}/analyze`
- `POST /api/projects/{id}/confirm`

`DELETE /api/projects/{id}` marks rows as deleted with `deletedAt`; it does not physically remove rows.

## Remotion Render Artifacts

`lab` remains the authenticated boundary for video preview/final renders. Flutter polls backend render jobs and receives `artifact.playback_url`; it never calls the Remotion worker, Cloud Run, or GCS directly.

Local mode uses the existing HMAC-protected artifact route backed by `CONTENTGLOWZ_RENDER_DIR`. Production mode uses a private GCS bucket:

- `CONTENTGLOWZ_RENDER_STORAGE=gcs`
- `REMOTION_WORKER_URL`
- `REMOTION_WORKER_TOKEN`
- `GCS_RENDER_BUCKET`
- `GCS_RENDER_PREFIX`, default `renders`
- `GCS_SIGNED_URL_TTL_SECONDS`, default `3600`

The backend persists the deterministic expected object key before dispatching a render. If worker memory loses a completed job after restart, the backend can reconcile from the expected GCS object; if the object is missing, the job fails with `render_artifact_unavailable` and no playback URL is returned.

Signed GCS playback URLs are bearer-like secrets. Do not copy query strings such as `X-Goog-Signature` into support tickets, diagnostics, or logs.

## Reader Checklist

- Read this file before changing project intelligence, project assets, video timeline, render artifact, image generation, GSC OAuth, or project-selection behavior.
- Cross-check worker render behavior with `shipglowz_data/technical/worker/architecture.md`.
- Update this file when a README-local backend contract would otherwise be reintroduced.

## Maintenance Rule

Keep durable backend API and runtime contracts here or in a narrower `shipglowz_data/technical/lab/*` module. Local `lab/README.md` stays a facade only.
