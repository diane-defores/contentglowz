## Layer breakdown

- **Presentation boundary (HTTP/WebSocket)**
  - `api/routers/*` expose route contracts and response models.
  - `api/main.py` centralizes middleware and app-wide behavior.

- **Application layer (composition + policy)**
  - `api/dependencies/*` implements auth ownership and provider injection.
  - `api/services/*` contains domain orchestration and external API integration logic.
  - `api/services/email_source_service.py` stores per-user IMAP email-source metadata in `UserSettings.robotSettings.emailSource` and the app password in encrypted `UserProviderCredential`.

- **Agent/domain service layer**
  - `agents/*` host the CrewAI/PydanticAI pipelines.
  - Heavy imports are deferred using `lru_cache` providers to protect startup latency.
  - Newsletter inbox ingestion reads a user-configured IMAP folder, extracts ideas, writes them to the Idea Pool with user/project ownership, and archives processed messages to the configured folder when possible.
  - Historical local README files under `lab/agents/*` are migration façades only; durable workflow documentation belongs in `shipglowz_data/technical/lab/agent-pipelines.md` and this architecture file.

- **Persistence layer**
  - User/project/security-critical state is persisted to Turso (`libsql`).
  - Status lifecycle uses local adapters with migration-safe schema bootstrapping.
  - Binary video-source originals are private, versioned S3 objects. Domain rows persist only a provider-neutral locator (`provider`, `namespace`, opaque object key, version, checksum), never a durable URL.
  - Upload-session provider state remains backend-only. Multipart URLs are signed per part only after the backend validates its expected number and size and binds its SHA-256 checksum.

## Video source intake boundary

- `Sources prêtes` records the exact ready revision and never dispatches generation.
- `Générer la vidéo` records the same readiness boundary, then emits one idempotent ids-only handoff. Generation, editing and rendering execute outside this intake surface.
- Images, MP4 video and supported audio enter a quarantine namespace, are decoded/inspected, stripped of private metadata, then written to the canonical `assets` namespace. Persistence failures trigger deletion compensation.
- Validated images also produce a bounded WebP thumbnail as a distinct derived asset/usage in S3. Video and audio use safe technical-metadata fallbacks until dedicated internal thumbnail/waveform generators are enabled; preview failure never rewrites or invalidates the original.
- Text is normalized and hashed through Project Intelligence primitives. Public links are revalidated on every redirect to prevent SSRF and only bounded, safe metadata is stored.
- Removing or replacing a source soft-deletes only its `video_source_folder` usage. The canonical asset remains governed by Unified Project Asset Library retention and other usages.
- `ObjectStorageProvider`, `MediaDeliveryProvider` and `MediaPreviewProvider` isolate provider-specific behavior. S3 is the only enabled canonical provider in V1.
- Bunny Optimizer or Stream may later implement preview delivery after latency/cost evidence demonstrates value. Bunny is disabled for this flow today: no source duplication and no Bunny credential is required.

### S3 operational requirements

- Private bucket with S3 Block Public Access enabled and Object Ownership set to bucket-owner-enforced.
- Versioning and default encryption enabled (`AES256` by default, optional KMS key).
- Runtime IAM role limited to the configured prefix and required multipart/read/delete/version operations; no credentials in Flutter.
- Lifecycle rules abort incomplete multipart uploads and expire quarantine objects after the agreed repair window, while canonical retention follows asset-library policy.
- CORS allows only trusted app origins and `PUT`, and exposes `ETag` plus `x-amz-checksum-sha256`; it must not make objects public.

- **Background processing**
  - In-process scheduler (`scheduler/scheduler_service.py`) executes periodic jobs and updates state transitions.
  - Jobs can invoke newsletter/SEO/social pipeline steps.
  - Some historical subsystems were documented as "agents" even when they behave as deterministic pipelines; architecture decisions should follow current code behavior, not legacy naming.

## External dependencies and boundaries

- **Clerk**
  - JWT auth validation for protected routes.
  - Webhook verification for user events (`api/routers/auth_web.py`).

- **AI/Research providers**
  - OpenRouter (primary LLM path) and provider-specific integrations managed by runtime mode + credential model.
  - Search/ crawler integrations (EXA, Firecrawl, dataforSEO, SERP, etc.) used by agent tools.

- **Email and productivity integrations**
  - SendGrid for outbound mail.
  - IMAP / Gmail-based newsletter intake paths in newsletter tools.
  - Per-user email source settings store non-secret IMAP metadata in `UserSettings.robotSettings.emailSource` and the app password in encrypted `UserProviderCredential`.
  - Saving an email source creates/updates a managed `ingest_newsletters` scheduler job. The job runs every 6 hours, reads the configured folder with the user's IMAP credentials, creates `newsletter_inbox` ideas for the configured project, and moves processed emails to the archive folder when IMAP supports it.

## Constraints and invariants

- Keep startup non-breaking:
  - scheduler startup and DB ensure calls must degrade gracefully on partial failure.
- Keep migrations additive:
  - add tables/columns with idempotent checks and startup safety.
- Keep auth consistent:
  - never bypass `require_current_user` for routes that expose user-owned data.
- Preserve request accountability:
  - ownership checks must remain for cross-project/resource access.
