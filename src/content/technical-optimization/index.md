# Technical Optimization Hub

Master your development workflow with our comprehensive technical optimization guides. From dependency reduction to build acceleration, these guides cover everything you need to optimize your development stack.

## 🚀 Dependency Management

Optimize your project dependencies for faster builds and smaller deployments.

### [How We Cut Dependencies by 50% (and Build Time by 40%)](./cut-dependencies-50-percent.md)

**TL;DR:** Reduced from 50+ to 25 packages by removing LangChain. Result: 40% faster builds, 500MB smaller Docker images, and 90% lower LLM costs.

**Key Results:**
- Dependencies: 52 → 25 (52% reduction)
- Build time: 10m → 6m (40% faster)
- Docker image: 2.5GB → 2.0GB (20% smaller)
- Monthly savings: $153/year

**Perfect for:** Python developers struggling with dependency bloat, Docker optimization, slow builds.

### [The Great Dependency Migration: LangChain to OpenRouter](./langchain-to-openrouter-migration.md)

**TL;DR:** Complete step-by-step migration from LangChain (40+ packages) to OpenRouter (3 packages). Achieved $0 LLM costs with free tiers and 90% cost reduction.

**Migration Results:**
- Dependencies: 40+ → 3 packages
- LLM costs: $20 → $0/month
- Build time: 22m → 13m (41% faster)
- Models accessible: 3 → 100+

**Includes:** Complete code examples, migration checklist, cost analysis.

### [Build Time Analytics](./build-analytics.md) *Coming Soon*

Measure, analyze, and optimize your build pipeline performance.

## 🎯 Optimization Checklist

Use this checklist to identify optimization opportunities in your project:

### Dependencies
- [ ] Audit `requirements.txt` for unused packages
- [ ] Check transitive dependencies with `pip list`
- [ ] Identify large packages (>100MB)
- [ ] Consider lighter alternatives
- [ ] Remove development dependencies from production

### Build Performance
- [ ] Measure baseline build time
- [ ] Identify slowest build steps
- [ ] Implement caching strategies
- [ ] Optimize Docker layers
- [ ] Use parallel builds where possible

### Infrastructure
- [ ] Review cloud provider costs
- [ ] Check for underutilized resources
- [ ] Implement auto-scaling
- [ ] Use spot instances for non-critical workloads
- [ ] Monitor performance metrics regularly

## 📊 Optimization Impact Metrics

Track these metrics before and after optimization:

| Metric | Before | After | Improvement |
|--------|--------|-------|-------------|
| **Dependencies** | Count packages | Count packages | % reduction |
| **Build Time** | Minutes | Minutes | % faster |
| **Docker Size** | GB | GB | % smaller |
| **Deploy Time** | Minutes | Minutes | % faster |
| **Cold Start** | Seconds | Seconds | % faster |

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Assess Current State** - Run the optimization checklist
2. **Pick Quick Wins** - Start with dependency reduction
3. **Measure Impact** - Track metrics before and after
4. **Iterate** - Continue optimizing based on results
