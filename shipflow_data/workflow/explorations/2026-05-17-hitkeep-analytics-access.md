## Problem Framing

ContentGlowz already has basic analytics access: authenticated users query analytics for their project domains, and Search Console data is scoped by project ownership. The gap is not "can we read analytics"; the gap is governed, shareable, programmatic access for humans, reports, and assistants without giving everyone full app/session access.

## Option Space

### Option A: Adopt HitKeep as analytics backend

- Summary: Use HitKeep for web analytics storage, dashboards, reports, roles, exports, and optional assistant access.
- Pros: Faster route to mature dashboard/reporting/RBAC features; self-host or managed; open exports; cookie-free orientation.
- Cons: Migration and product fit risk; duplicate data model with ContentGlowz projects/domains; integration work for app identity, project ownership, and Search Console semantics.

### Option B: Copy the access model, keep our tracker

- Summary: Keep current private tracker and Search Console store, but add HitKeep-inspired access primitives.
- Pros: Fits existing ContentGlowz data model; lower migration risk; preserves current Search Console/editorial opportunity integration.
- Cons: We must build RBAC/API-client/share/report features ourselves; needs careful security design and audit logging.

### Option C: Do nothing beyond current owner-only access

- Summary: Keep analytics visible only through authenticated app/project ownership.
- Pros: Lowest implementation cost and simplest security posture.
- Cons: No read-only stakeholder access, no scoped assistant/reporting tokens, no shareable dashboards, no real analytics permission model.

### Option D: Copy Clamp's agent-native analytics loop

- Summary: Keep our own tracker, but expose a read-only analytics tool surface for agents with predefined analysis workflows.
- Pros: Strong fit for ContentGlowz because agents already create content, landing pages, reels, newsletters, and project intelligence; closes the loop from shipped content to measured outcome.
- Cons: Higher prompt/tool safety burden; requires strict scoped credentials, query limits, and careful separation between read-only diagnosis and write actions.

## Comparison

HitKeep is most useful as a reference architecture for access governance:

- Roles: instance/team and per-site roles map to workspace/project/domain roles.
- API clients: scoped bearer tokens map to reporting jobs, internal tools, and agents.
- Read-only assistant/MCP access: aggregate analytics can be exposed without dashboard cookies or write access.
- Share links and scheduled reports: stakeholders can consume analytics without becoming full app users.
- Exports: open data takeout improves trust and reduces lock-in.

Clamp is more useful as a reference architecture for agent workflows:

- MCP-first query model: analytics is available where the agent works, not only in dashboards.
- Prompt workflows: weekly report, traffic diagnosis, conversion audit, channel breakdown, and page performance can become first-class ContentGlowz analysis actions.
- Event schema: product/content events need typed names and properties so agents can ask reliable questions.
- Alerts: analytics should trigger follow-up work when traffic, conversion, or publishing outcomes move.

## Emerging Recommendation

Do not replace the current system immediately. Use HitKeep as the design benchmark for a ContentGlowz-native analytics access layer, and Clamp as the benchmark for agent-native analysis workflows:

1. Add an explicit analytics capability model: `analytics:view`, `analytics:export`, `analytics:share`, `analytics:connect`, `analytics:sync`, `analytics:admin`.
2. Introduce project/domain-scoped read-only API clients for reports and agents.
3. Add shareable read-only dashboard/report links with expiration, revocation, and audit logs.
4. Keep Search Console OAuth ownership stricter than private traffic viewing.
5. Add Clamp-style predefined analysis tools: weekly report, traffic diagnosis, page/content performance, channel quality, and conversion audit.
6. Consider HitKeep or Clamp as a parallel pilot for one site only if we need richer event/funnel reporting quickly.

Confidence: medium. HitKeep and Clamp's public claims are clear, but a production decision would require testing the live products/APIs and reviewing their security model.

## Non-Decisions

- No decision to migrate analytics storage to HitKeep.
- No decision to expose MCP in ContentGlowz yet.
- No decision on paid/managed HitKeep Cloud.
- No decision on paid/managed Clamp.

## Rejected Paths

- Immediate replacement of ContentGlowz analytics - rejected because our Search Console/editorial intelligence integration is already app-specific.
- Giving assistants normal user sessions - rejected because HitKeep's pattern points to scoped read-only API clients instead.
- Letting agents create alerts/funnels or open PRs without human review - rejected for V1 because analytics tooling should start read-only and diagnostic.

## Risks And Unknowns

- HitKeep maturity: product was featured recently, so reliability and long-term maintenance need validation.
- Clamp maturity: product was featured recently, so reliability, auth design, MCP safety, and retention/export posture need validation.
- Compliance: cookie-free does not automatically settle ePrivacy/PECR/GDPR questions, especially where sessionStorage or similar client storage is used.
- Data model mismatch: ContentGlowz project/domain/user ownership may not map cleanly to HitKeep site/team permissions.
- Security: scoped tokens and share links need revocation, expiry, audit logs, and rate limits from day one.

## Redaction Review

- Reviewed: yes
- Sensitive inputs seen: none
- Redactions applied: none
- Notes: Report summarizes code and public web sources only.

## Decision Inputs For Spec

- User story seed: As a project owner, I can grant read-only analytics access to stakeholders, jobs, and approved assistants without granting full workspace access, and I can ask an approved assistant to diagnose content performance from scoped aggregate data.
- Scope in seed: analytics permissions, API clients, read-only shares, audit logs, UI states, backend enforcement, predefined agent analysis workflows.
- Scope out seed: full migration to HitKeep; public write APIs beyond existing collect; session replay.
- Invariants/constraints seed: backend-enforced project ownership; Search Console OAuth remains owner/admin-only; tokens are scoped, revocable, expiring, and read-only by default.
- Validation seed: authorization tests across owner/viewer/token/share states; expired/revoked token tests; UI checks for degraded access states.

## Handoff

- Recommended next command: `/sf-spec Analytics access governance`
- Why this next step: The access model affects security and product behavior, so it should be specified before implementation.
