## Title

Remotion render service integration

## Status

Ready after `sf-ready` rerun. This spec defines the technical integration layer only. The user-facing `/reels` workflow is covered by `shipflow_data/workflow/specs/monorepo/reels-from-content-preview-workflow.md`.

## User Story

En tant que createur ContentFlow authentifie, je veux lancer un rendu Remotion depuis un contenu existant, afin d'obtenir une preview puis un MP4 local depuis l'app.

## Minimal Behavior Contract

ContentFlow accepte une demande de rendu 60 secondes pour un contenu existant appartenant a l'utilisateur courant, cree un job persistant, transforme ce contenu en props de composition Remotion, delegue le rendu a un worker Remotion local et expose un statut ainsi qu'une URL d'artefact local signee valable 24h quand le rendu est termine. Si le contenu est absent, n'appartient pas a l'utilisateur, n'a pas de corps exploitable, depasse les limites de rendu, ou si le worker echoue, le job devient observable en erreur sans produire d'artefact annonce comme pret. Le cas facile a rater est la separation entre `preview` et `final`: un rendu final ne peut etre cree que depuis un `preview_job_id` termine et ne doit jamais reutiliser un ancien artefact preview ou un job d'un autre utilisateur.

## Success Behavior

- Given un utilisateur Clerk authentifie et un `content_id` appartenant a son projet actif, when the API receives `POST /api/reels/render-jobs` with `template_id=content-summary-v1`, `duration_seconds=60`, and optional `client_request_id`, then it creates or returns the user's active preview job for that same content/template and persists `job_type=reel_render`, `status=queued`, `progress=0`, `render_mode=preview`, and the selected content metadata.
- Given the worker is reachable, when the lab API dispatches the preview job, then the worker renders an MP4 preview into the shared local render directory and the API returns status `completed`, `progress=100`, `artifact_url`, `artifact_expires_at` exactly 24h after URL issuance, `retention_expires_at` 30 days after completion, and `deletion_warning_at` 72h before retention expiry.
- Given the preview has completed, when the client requests `POST /api/reels/render-jobs/{preview_job_id}/export`, then the API creates a separate final job linked by `parent_preview_job_id`, or returns the already-existing final job if one is queued, in progress, or completed for that preview.
- Given a terminal job, when the user polls the job endpoint, then the response is stable and includes timestamps, mode, template id, status, progress, message, and artifact metadata when available.
- Proof of success is a local MP4 file under the configured render directory, a persisted job record, a successful API status response, and passing API tests with a fake worker.

## Error Behavior

- Missing or invalid bearer token returns `401` through existing `require_current_user`.
- A `content_id` outside the current user's projects returns `403` or `404` via `require_owned_content_record`; it must not leak title, path, metadata, or render status.
- Empty body, missing title, unsupported template id, unsupported render mode, or invalid duration returns `400` and does not dispatch the worker.
- Duration other than `60` returns `400`; the MVP supports only 60-second reels.
- Source content longer than 20,000 characters is deterministically truncated to the first 20,000 characters before props creation, with `metadata.content_truncated=true`; malformed props or props above 64KB after compaction return `400`.
- If the user already has one active render job, or the local worker already has three active render jobs globally, the API returns `429 Too Many Requests` with `Retry-After: 60` and `retry_after_seconds=60`; no worker job is created.
- Worker unavailable, timeout, invalid worker response, Remotion failure, or disk write failure marks the job `failed` with a sanitized message and no ready artifact URL.
- Final export requested for a missing, failed, cancelled, in-progress, or non-owned preview job returns `400`, `404`, or `403` as appropriate and does not create a final job.
- Cancellation of a queued or in-progress job marks the job `cancelled` if the worker confirms cancellation; if cancellation fails, the job remains observable and can still complete or fail.
- Expired, malformed, or job-mismatched artifact tokens return `403` and do not reveal whether the file exists.
- File paths supplied by requests are ignored. Artifact paths are generated server-side from job ids and safe extensions only.
- No secret, bearer token, local absolute content path, or raw worker token is logged or returned.

## Problem

The `contentflowz/remotion-template` prototype proves that Remotion can render a vertical MP4, but it is a standalone Node/Express server with an in-memory queue, Telegram side effects, and a quiz-specific schema. ContentFlow's production backend is FastAPI with Clerk auth, Turso-backed job persistence, project ownership checks, and Flutter clients. Copying the prototype directly would bypass existing security, persistence, and app patterns.

## Solution

Introduce a small isolated Remotion worker as a companion service and make `contentglowz_lab` the only authenticated public API. The lab API validates the content and user, persists job state in the existing `JobStore`, dispatches sanitized render props to the worker over an internal HTTP contract, and serves local artifacts from a configured shared render directory.

## Scope In

- Create a new local service directory `contentglowz_remotion_worker/` derived from the Remotion prototype, with Node, TypeScript, React, Remotion, and a minimal HTTP API.
- Add a `ReelFromContent` Remotion composition that accepts structured content props, not raw arbitrary files.
- Support two render modes: `preview` and `final`, both fixed to 60 seconds for MVP.
- Use vertical 9:16 H.264 MP4 output for MVP.
- Use local shared artifact storage through `CONTENTFLOW_RENDER_DIR`.
- Use a simple visual template for MVP: title, hook/intro, 3 to 5 key points extracted from the content, and a final CTA. Voice, subtitles, and generated music are deferred.
- Add lab API models and endpoints under `/api/reels/render-jobs`.
- Use existing Clerk auth and content ownership helpers before dispatching any render.
- Use existing `api.services.job_store.job_store` for persistent job state.
- Add a lab-side Remotion worker client using `httpx.AsyncClient`.
- Add job polling that refreshes worker status when a job is not terminal.
- Add signed local artifact serving through lab API, not direct public worker access. Creation and polling endpoints stay Clerk-authenticated; media playback uses a signed artifact URL valid for 24h because Flutter Web video playback cannot rely on bearer headers.
- Add cancellation support for queued or in-progress jobs.
- Add anti-abuse limits for local rendering: one active render per user, three active renders globally, 20,000 source characters max before deterministic truncation, 64KB compacted props max, and `429` with `Retry-After: 60` when capacity is exceeded.
- Add local retention: preview and final artifacts are retained for 30 days; completed job responses expose `retention_expires_at` and `deletion_warning_at`, and cleanup removes expired artifacts on worker startup plus daily worker maintenance.
- Add tests for API validation, ownership behavior, worker error mapping, and artifact path safety.

## Scope Out

- CDN or object storage upload.
- Cloud rendering, Remotion Lambda, Railway deployment, or autoscaling.
- Social publishing of the MP4.
- Telegram delivery from the prototype.
- A full timeline editor.
- Multi-template marketplace.
- Audio generation, voiceover, captions, or music.
- Voiceover, auto subtitles, and generated music for reels.
- Browser-embedded Remotion Player in Flutter.
- New Turso tables beyond the existing `jobs` table.

## Constraints

- `contentglowz_lab` remains the public API boundary. The Remotion worker is internal and must require an internal token if reachable over HTTP.
- The worker and lab API are co-located for MVP and share `CONTENTFLOW_RENDER_DIR`.
- Local files are acceptable for MVP; production object storage is a later migration.
- The API must stay compatible with degraded app behavior: render creation is not offline-queued and should fail clearly when backend or worker is unavailable.
- The worker must not bundle Remotion on every render. The official Remotion docs call repeated `bundle()` per video an anti-pattern.
- `inputProps` must be passed consistently to both `selectComposition()` and `renderMedia()`.
- Artifact serving must use allowlisted paths under `CONTENTFLOW_RENDER_DIR`.
- Artifact playback URLs must be signed, scoped to `job_id`, `render_mode`, `artifact_path_hash`, and `exp`, and valid for exactly 24h. They must not require a browser video element to send Clerk bearer headers.
- Signed URL revocation is not required for local MVP. If a user loses project access after a URL is issued, the old URL can remain usable until its 24h expiry; fresh URL issuance and job polling must be denied.
- Preview and final artifacts are deleted after 30 days in local mode. Responses must expose deletion timing so the app can warn users before deletion.
- A Turso migration is not required for MVP because the existing `jobs` table stores extra JSON data.

## Dependencies

- `contentglowz_lab`: FastAPI, Clerk auth, ownership helpers, `JobStore`, `httpx`.
- `contentglowz_remotion_worker`: `@remotion/bundler`, `@remotion/renderer`, `remotion`, React, TypeScript, Express or a similarly small Node HTTP server.
- Local environment variables:
  - `REMOTION_WORKER_URL`
  - `REMOTION_WORKER_TOKEN`
  - `CONTENTFLOW_RENDER_DIR`
  - `RENDER_ARTIFACT_SIGNING_KEY`
  - `RENDER_MAX_ACTIVE_PER_USER=1`
  - `RENDER_MAX_ACTIVE_GLOBAL=3`
  - `RENDER_ARTIFACT_RETENTION_DAYS=30`
  - `REMOTION_SERVE_URL` optional, for a prebuilt bundle.
- API contract:
  - `POST /api/reels/render-jobs`
    - request: `{"content_id": "...", "template_id": "content-summary-v1", "duration_seconds": 60, "client_request_id": "optional-client-uuid"}`
    - success: `ReelRenderJobResponse`
    - duplicate active preview: return the existing active preview job for the same `user_id`, `content_id`, `template_id`, and `render_mode=preview`.
  - `GET /api/reels/render-jobs/{job_id}`
    - success: latest `ReelRenderJobResponse`, refreshed from worker when non-terminal.
  - `POST /api/reels/render-jobs/{preview_job_id}/export`
    - request: `{"client_request_id": "optional-client-uuid"}`
    - precondition: `preview_job_id` is owned by the current user, `render_mode=preview`, and `status=completed`.
    - duplicate final export: return the existing final job if one linked to the preview is `queued`, `in_progress`, or `completed`; create a new final only after a previous final is `failed` or `cancelled`.
  - `DELETE /api/reels/render-jobs/{job_id}`
    - success: normalized cancellation response for queued or in-progress jobs.
  - `GET /api/reels/render-jobs/{job_id}/artifact?token=...`
    - no Clerk bearer is required; token verification is mandatory.
- `ReelRenderJobResponse` fields: `job_id`, `job_type`, `status`, `progress`, `message`, `content_id`, `project_id`, `template_id`, `render_mode`, `duration_seconds`, `parent_preview_job_id`, `worker_job_id`, `artifact`, `created_at`, `updated_at`.
- `artifact` fields when present: `artifact_url`, `artifact_expires_at`, `retention_expires_at`, `deletion_warning_at`, `byte_size`, `mime_type`, `render_mode`, `file_name`.
- Fresh external docs checked:
  - `fresh-docs checked`: Remotion `renderMedia()` official docs confirm programmatic rendering, `outputLocation`, `inputProps`, `onProgress`, and `cancelSignal`.
  - `fresh-docs checked`: Remotion `bundle()` official docs confirm that a bundle can render multiple parametrized videos and should not be called for every video.
  - `fresh-docs checked`: Remotion `selectComposition()` official docs confirm composition selection from a bundle and the need for JSON `inputProps`.

## Invariants

- Every render job is tied to `user_id`, `project_id`, `content_id`, `template_id`, and `render_mode`.
- `preview` and `final` artifacts are separate files with separate metadata.
- Final jobs always store `parent_preview_job_id`; preview jobs always have `parent_preview_job_id=null`.
- Worker output paths are separate for preview and final: `previews/{preview_job_id}.mp4` and `finals/{final_job_id}.mp4`.
- A user can only see, poll, cancel, or download jobs whose `user_id` matches their Clerk user and whose content is still in an owned project.
- Artifact URLs are signed and expire after 24h; the signature payload includes `job_id`, `render_mode`, `artifact_path_hash`, and expiry.
- Worker endpoints never become a public user-facing API.
- Job status values are normalized by lab API: `queued`, `in_progress`, `completed`, `failed`, `cancelled`.
- Completion requires an existing MP4 file with non-zero byte size under `CONTENTFLOW_RENDER_DIR`.
- Worker errors are sanitized before storage and response.

## Links & Consequences

- `contentglowz_app` will consume the new endpoints in the follow-up workflow spec.
- `contentglowz_lab/api/routers/reels.py` currently handles Instagram import; render endpoints should be added in a separate router module to keep responsibilities readable.
- `contentglowz_lab/api/main.py` and `contentglowz_lab/api/routers/__init__.py` must include the new router.
- Existing `JobStore.ensure_table()` remains sufficient; no new DB migration is required for this spec.
- Local render files are retained for 30 days in MVP, then removed by worker cleanup on startup and daily maintenance. Completed job responses expose deletion timing for app warnings.
- Render output URLs will be signed API URLs, not permanent CDN URLs.

## Documentation Coherence

- Update `contentglowz_lab/README.md` or `contentglowz_lab/ENVIRONMENT_SETUP.md` with the worker URL, token, render directory, and local startup steps.
- Add `contentglowz_remotion_worker/README.md` with install, dev, render, and test commands.
- Add a short note in `contentglowz_app/README.md` only after the app workflow spec is implemented.
- Changelog entry required for new `/api/reels/render-jobs` API contract.

## Edge Cases

- Content record exists but body cannot be read from disk or cache.
- Content body is too long for the template and must be summarized or truncated deterministically.
- Content contains markdown, HTML, code blocks, emoji, or unsupported characters.
- Worker finishes but output file is missing or zero bytes.
- Worker returns completed for an unknown external render id.
- API restarts while worker render continues; next poll must recover by checking stored worker id.
- User loses access to the project after job creation but before artifact download.
- Signed artifact URL expires while the preview player is open; the app must refresh job status to receive a fresh URL.
- Concurrent preview and final requests for the same content should not overwrite each other's file.
- Repeated final export requests for the same completed preview return the existing final job while it is queued, in progress, or completed.
- Local capacity is full and the API must return `429` with `Retry-After`.
- Artifact is within 72h of deletion and the app needs `deletion_warning_at` to warn before local cleanup.
- Disk full or render directory missing.
- Path traversal attempt through job id or artifact file name.

  - User story link: Provides the render engine without replacing the FastAPI stack.
  - Depends on: None.
  - Validate with: `npm install` and `npm run lint` from `contentglowz_remotion_worker`.
  - Notes: Keep this out of `contentflowz/`; that directory remains inspiration/prototype material.

- [ ] Tache 2: Port the Remotion root and add a content-based composition.
  - Fichier: `contentglowz_remotion_worker/remotion/Root.tsx`
  - Action: Register `ReelFromContent` with 1080x1920, 30fps, and zod-validated props.
  - User story link: Produces vertical reels from ContentFlow content.
  - Depends on: Tache 1.
  - Validate with: `npm run remotion:studio` and a sample props JSON.
  - Notes: Do not keep quiz-only assumptions as the primary composition.

- [ ] Tache 3: Implement worker render API and local artifact writes.
  - Fichier: `contentglowz_remotion_worker/server/index.ts`
  - Action: Add `POST /renders`, `GET /renders/:workerJobId`, `DELETE /renders/:workerJobId`, and internal artifact metadata. Use `outputLocation` instead of in-memory buffers for MVP.
  - User story link: Lets lab create and track preview/final MP4 renders.
  - Depends on: Tache 2.
  - Validate with: Curl a sample render and confirm a non-empty MP4 under `CONTENTFLOW_RENDER_DIR`.
  - Notes: Require `REMOTION_WORKER_TOKEN` on non-health endpoints.

- [ ] Tache 4: Add worker path safety and retention helpers.
  - Fichier: `contentglowz_remotion_worker/server/render-storage.ts`
  - Action: Generate safe output paths from server-side ids, validate all paths stay under `CONTENTFLOW_RENDER_DIR`, compute 30-day retention metadata, and expose cleanup for expired preview/final artifacts.
  - User story link: Prevents unsafe local file exposure.
  - Depends on: Tache 3.
  - Validate with: Unit tests for path traversal attempts, extension allowlist, 30-day retention expiry, and 72h deletion warning timestamp.
  - Notes: Allowed output extension for MVP is `.mp4`.

- [ ] Tache 5: Define lab API request/response models.
  - Fichier: `contentglowz_lab/api/models/reel_render.py`
  - Action: Add Pydantic models for create preview, create final, job response, artifact metadata, and cancellation response.
  - User story link: Creates a stable contract for the Flutter app.
  - Depends on: None.
  - Validate with: `python -m compileall api/models/reel_render.py`.
  - Notes: Include `content_id`, `template_id`, `render_mode`, `duration_seconds`, `status`, `progress`, `artifact_url`, and `artifact_expires_at`.

- [ ] Tache 6: Add a lab-side Remotion worker client.
  - Fichier: `contentglowz_lab/api/services/remotion_render_client.py`
  - Action: Wrap worker calls with internal token, timeout handling, sanitized error mapping, and response validation.
  - User story link: Keeps worker details outside routers.
  - Depends on: Tache 5.
  - Validate with: Unit tests using a mocked `httpx.AsyncClient`.
  - Notes: Do not log request bodies containing content text.

- [ ] Tache 7: Add signed artifact URL helper.
  - Fichier: `contentglowz_lab/api/services/render_artifact_tokens.py`
  - Action: Implement HMAC signing and verification for artifact URLs using `RENDER_ARTIFACT_SIGNING_KEY`, scoped to job id, render mode, artifact path hash, and `exp` exactly 24h after issuance.
  - User story link: Allows Flutter Web video playback without exposing public worker URLs or relying on bearer headers in the video element.
  - Depends on: Tache 5.
  - Validate with: Unit tests for valid token, expired token, wrong job id, wrong path hash, and malformed token.
  - Notes: Do not reuse `USER_SECRETS_MASTER_KEY`; use a dedicated signing env var. Revocation before 24h is out of MVP scope, but fresh token issuance must still re-check ownership.

- [ ] Tache 8: Add authenticated render endpoints.
  - Fichier: `contentglowz_lab/api/routers/reel_renders.py`
  - Action: Implement `/api/reels/render-jobs`, `/api/reels/render-jobs/{job_id}`, `/api/reels/render-jobs/{preview_job_id}/export`, `/api/reels/render-jobs/{job_id}/artifact`, and cancellation. Job create/poll/cancel endpoints require Clerk auth; artifact endpoint accepts a valid signed artifact token.
  - User story link: Public API for the app to create, poll, export, and download local videos.
  - Depends on: Taches 5, 6, and 7.
  - Validate with: Pytest API tests covering success, invalid input, unauthorized content, worker failure, and artifact safety.
  - Notes: Use `require_current_user`, `require_owned_content_record`, and `job_store` for non-artifact endpoints; use token verification plus stored job metadata for artifact reads. Enforce one active render per user, three global active renders, 60-second duration only, 20,000-character source cap, 64KB compacted props cap, and `429` with `Retry-After: 60`.

  - Depends on: Taches 8-12.
  - Validate with: Documentation review.
  - Notes: Include "Turso migration required: no, uses existing jobs table".

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] CA 1: Given an authenticated user and owned content with a readable body, when the user creates a preview render job, then the API returns `202` or `200` with a `job_id`, `status=queued`, and `render_mode=preview`.
- [ ] CA 2: Given a queued job and a reachable worker, when the job is polled until completion, then the API returns `status=completed`, `progress=100`, a signed `artifact_url`, an `artifact_expires_at` exactly 24h after issuance, `retention_expires_at` 30 days after completion, and `deletion_warning_at` 72h before retention expiry.
- [ ] CA 3: Given a completed owned preview job, when the user requests final export through `/api/reels/render-jobs/{preview_job_id}/export`, then a final render is created with `render_mode=final`, `parent_preview_job_id=preview_job_id`, and a separate final MP4 artifact path.
- [ ] CA 4: Given a content id outside the user's projects, when render creation is requested, then the API returns `403` or `404` without content metadata.
- [ ] CA 5: Given empty content or unsupported template id, when render creation is requested, then the API returns `400` and no worker job is created.
- [ ] CA 6: Given the worker is down, when render creation or status refresh happens, then the job is marked `failed` or the response explains worker unavailability without crashing the API.
- [ ] CA 7: Given a malicious artifact path attempt or invalid artifact token, when the artifact endpoint is called, then the API rejects it and never reads outside `CONTENTFLOW_RENDER_DIR`.
- [ ] CA 8: Given a terminal failed job, when it is polled repeatedly, then the response stays failed with a sanitized message and no ready artifact URL.
- [ ] CA 9: Given an API restart after dispatch, when a non-terminal job with a worker id is polled, then lab refreshes status from the worker and persists the latest state.
- [ ] CA 10: Given a queued or in-progress job, when cancellation is requested by its owner, then the worker cancellation is attempted and the normalized job status becomes `cancelled` or remains observable with a clear failure message.
- [ ] CA 11: Given the user already has one active render or the local worker has three active renders globally, when a new preview/export is requested, then the API returns `429 Too Many Requests`, `Retry-After: 60`, and creates no new worker job.
- [ ] CA 12: Given a source content body longer than 20,000 characters, when preview creation is requested, then the backend truncates deterministically to 20,000 characters, marks `metadata.content_truncated=true`, and still respects the 64KB compacted props cap.
- [ ] CA 13: Given final export is requested twice for the same completed preview while the final job is queued, in progress, or completed, then the API returns the same final job id and does not create a duplicate worker render.
- [ ] CA 14: Given an artifact is older than 30 days, when worker cleanup runs on startup or daily maintenance, then the local file is removed and subsequent artifact access fails safely.
- [ ] CA 15: Given a user loses project access after a signed URL is issued, when the old URL is used before its 24h expiry, then MVP may still serve it; when the user requests fresh job status or a fresh artifact URL, then ownership is rechecked and denied.

## Test Strategy

- Unit test worker storage helpers for safe path generation.
- Worker smoke test with sample props to generate a local MP4.
- Lab unit tests for Pydantic validation and worker client error mapping.
- Lab API tests with fake auth/current user and fake worker client.
- Lab API tests for `429` capacity, invalid duration, deterministic truncation, duplicate final export, expired artifact token, and lost access on fresh status/token issuance.
- Worker storage tests for 30-day cleanup and 72h deletion warning metadata.
- Manual local test: run FastAPI and worker, create a preview job from known content, poll, and download artifact.
- Regression check: existing `/api/reels/download` Instagram flow still imports and routes unchanged.
- Validation commands:
  - `python -m compileall api`
  - `pytest tests/test_reel_renders.py`
  - `npm run lint` in `contentglowz_remotion_worker`
  - `curl` smoke test against local worker and lab API

## Risks

- High integration risk: Python API, Node worker, local filesystem, and Flutter consumer must agree on contracts.
- Security risk: local artifact serving can expose files if path validation is weak.
- Operational risk: local disk can fill up without cleanup.
- Reliability risk: worker queue state can diverge from persisted job state after restarts.
- Performance risk: Remotion renders are CPU-heavy and can block small hosts.
- Media auth risk: browser video playback cannot reliably attach Clerk bearer headers, so signed artifact URLs must be implemented carefully with the agreed 24h TTL.
- Licensing/commercial risk: Remotion's commercial terms should be reviewed before production SaaS use.

  - `contentflowz/remotion-template/server/index.ts`
  - `contentflowz/remotion-template/server/render-queue.ts`
  - `contentglowz_lab/api/services/job_store.py`
  - `contentglowz_lab/api/dependencies/ownership.py`
  - `contentglowz_lab/api/routers/reels.py`
- Implement foundation first: worker package, composition, worker API, then lab models/client/router.
- Keep Remotion code isolated in `contentglowz_remotion_worker/`; do not add Node dependencies to `contentglowz_lab/requirements`.
- Keep lab API as the auth and ownership gate. Do not expose worker URLs directly to Flutter.
- Use `outputLocation` for file output to avoid large in-memory buffers.
- Do not implement CDN, voiceover, captions, or social publishing in this chantier.
- Stop and reroute if worker and lab cannot share a local directory in the intended deployment environment; that requires an object-storage spec.
- Treat `429` as local backpressure, not an application error to retry in a tight loop.
- Normal render polling cadence is client-defined by the app spec; signed artifact URL expiry is 24h and is unrelated to polling cadence.

## Open Questions

None blocking for MVP. Deferred decisions are CDN storage, cloud rendering, voiceover, subtitles, generated music, and production Remotion licensing.

## Skill Run History

| Date UTC | Skill | Model | Action | Result | Next step |
|----------|-------|-------|--------|--------|-----------|
| 2026-05-11 09:15:20 | sf-spec | GPT-5 Codex | Created spec from `contentflowz/remotion-template` and user decisions. | Draft saved. | /sf-ready remotion-render-service-integration |
| 2026-05-11 09:43:54 | sf-ready | GPT-5 Codex | Evaluated readiness gate for Remotion worker, FastAPI render jobs, signed local artifacts, and local storage. | Not ready: security/availability limits, artifact token contract, final render relationship, and retention policy need concrete decisions. | /sf-spec Remotion render service integration |
| 2026-05-11 12:41:59 | sf-spec | GPT-5 Codex | Revised spec with user decisions on signed URL TTL, 60-second MVP, 429/backpressure, 30-day local retention, preview-to-final contract, and media scope. | Draft revised for readiness rerun. | /sf-ready remotion-render-service-integration |
| 2026-05-11 12:48:38 | sf-ready | GPT-5 Codex | Re-evaluated readiness after revised render limits, signed artifact, retention, preview/final, and media scope decisions. | Ready. | /sf-start Remotion render service integration |
| 2026-05-14 16:10:00 | sf-start | GPT-5 Codex | Implemented Batch 0 foundation: `contentglowz_remotion_worker/`, lab render-job API routes/models/services, signed artifact token checks, and focused fake-worker tests. | Partial chantier delivery complete for prerequisite scope; focused backend tests passing. | /sf-verify Remotion render service integration |
| 2026-05-14 16:45:00 | sf-start | GPT-5 Codex | Lifted worker duration validation for `ContentFlowTimelineVideo` to support timeline renders up to 180 seconds while preserving the 60-second `ReelFromContent` contract. | Timeline worker integration aligned with unified video timeline Batch 3. | /sf-verify Remotion render service integration |
