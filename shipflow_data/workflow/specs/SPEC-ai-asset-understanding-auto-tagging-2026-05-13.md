# Title

AI Asset Understanding Auto Tagging

## Status

Closed after final verification. This spec defines the product and technical contract for understanding, tagging and recommending project image/video assets. It extends the existing Unified Project Asset Library into a two-level library: a user/workspace-scoped reusable asset library plus project-level asset attachments/views. It does not introduce a public DAM or free-form provider playground.

## User Story

En tant que creatrice ContentFlow, je veux que mes images et videos de projet soient comprises, taguees et recommandees automatiquement, afin de retrouver des illustrations et b-rolls pertinents pour mes futurs contenus sans trier toute ma mediatheque a la main.

## Minimal Behavior Contract

When an image or video asset is added, imported, captured, attached to a project, or explicitly re-analyzed, ContentFlow stores or reuses a user/workspace-scoped canonical asset, links it to the current project when applicable, and creates an authenticated async understanding job subject to strict cost/privacy guardrails. The job extracts safe media signals, resolves a provider credential from user BYOK first and platform/global key second, asks a Gemini-compatible analyzer to summarize what the asset depicts, stores normalized tags, scene segments, b-roll or illustration placements, confidence scores and source-credit metadata, and makes those signals searchable from the global library and recommendable inside authorized project workflows. If analysis is unavailable, unsafe, too large, unsupported, quota-limited, or low-confidence, the asset remains usable but is marked with a recoverable understanding status instead of receiving misleading tags. The easy edge case to miss is social or third-party footage: recommendations may say a deer-jumping clip fits a kung-fu video as an eye-catching illustration, but they must preserve source attribution/credit warnings and must not invent legal permission.

## Success Behavior

- Given an owned project asset is an image, capture, thumbnail, video, video cover, render output, or imported social video, when analysis is requested, then the backend creates an `asset_understanding` job scoped to the project/user and records status `queued`.
- Given an asset already exists in the user's global library, when it is attached to a new project, then ContentFlow reuses the canonical asset understanding result and records a project-level attachment/usage rather than duplicating the media or re-running analysis by default.
- Given the job runs on an image, when the analyzer succeeds, then the asset receives normalized visual tags, detected objects/scene concepts, suggested placements such as `illustration`, `thumbnail_candidate`, `visual_reference_candidate`, and confidence metadata.
- Given the job runs on a video, when the analyzer succeeds, then the asset receives video-level tags plus timestamped scene segments with start/end seconds, short labels, b-roll or illustration suitability, and confidence metadata.
- Given a video has audio or visible UI text, when the analyzer supports audio/vision/OCR, then the stored result may include safe high-level cues such as "signup flow", "dashboard", "waterfall", "animal movement", "martial arts motion", or "software demo", but not full sensitive OCR dumps by default.
- Given the asset came from a social network or external creator, when it is recommended, then the response includes `source_attribution`, `credit_text` and a rights/reuse warning if permission is unknown.
- Given the user or automation asks for assets for a future content brief, when tags exist, then the recommendation endpoint returns ranked owned project assets with fit reasons, suggested usage (`b_roll`, `illustration`, `background_visual`, `thumbnail_candidate`) and warnings.
- Given the request allows reusable assets, when recommendations run for a project, then ranking can include assets from the same user's global library that are not yet attached to that project, but the response must mark them as `candidate_global_asset` and require explicit attachment before use.
- Given both user BYOK and platform provider credentials exist, when an understanding job runs, then the user BYOK credential is used first; if it is absent or disabled, the platform/global credential may be used; if neither is configured, the job returns `provider_not_configured`.
- Given tags are low-confidence, when they are shown in the app, then they appear as suggestions rather than accepted user tags and do not dominate recommendations.
- Given a user accepts, edits, or rejects AI tags, when the asset is reloaded, then accepted user tags are preserved and AI suggestions remain traceable separately.

## Error Behavior

- If the user is unauthenticated, return `401` through the existing Clerk dependency.
- If the project or asset is not owned by the current user, return `403` or `404` using existing ownership conventions and do not reveal whether another user's asset exists.
- If the media is unsupported, missing storage, tombstoned, local-only without upload, too large, or cannot be sampled, mark understanding `failed` or `degraded` with a typed non-secret error and keep existing asset usability unchanged.
- If the analyzer provider is not configured, create no misleading tags; return `provider_not_configured` or leave the job `blocked` with a visible setup status.
- If media or job volume exceeds configured guardrails, do not call the provider; mark the job `skipped_limit_exceeded`, `quota_exceeded`, or `needs_trim` with recoverable non-secret details.
- If the provider times out or returns malformed output, mark the job failed with normalized error metadata and allow retry.
- If generated tags include unsafe, private, or copyrighted claims beyond the evidence, discard or downgrade them; never store provider raw payloads as user-facing truth.
- If source attribution is missing for third-party/social footage, recommendations must include `rights_status: unknown` and `credit_required: true` instead of silently treating the asset as free to reuse.
- What must never happen: cross-project asset leakage, automatic use of third-party media without attribution warning, provider keys in logs/responses, storing raw frame images/OCR transcripts unnecessarily, or auto-publishing an asset purely because AI recommended it.

## Problem

ContentFlow now has a unified project asset layer, but assets are still mostly passive files. The system does not know whether a video shows a SaaS signup, a waterfall, a person demonstrating a product, a deer jumping, an abstract background, or a useful b-roll segment. This blocks future workflows from automatically choosing relevant visuals for articles, social posts, reels, thumbnails, or video scenes.

## Solution

Add an AI asset-understanding layer on top of Project Asset Library. The backend keeps a canonical user/workspace asset record for reusable media, links those assets to projects through project-level attachments/usages, runs async analysis jobs, stores normalized tags/segments/credit metadata, and exposes search/recommendation APIs. The Flutter app surfaces suggested tags and recommendation reasons inside the existing asset picker/library, with confidence and attribution warnings. Provider choice remains pluggable and BYOK-friendly, but V1 implementation must include a Gemini-compatible adapter path because official Gemini docs support audio+visual video analysis and timestamps; OpenAI vision/speech-to-text remain useful fallback hooks for image/frame/audio workflows.

## Scope In

- Analyze existing and future project assets with media kinds `image`, `thumbnail`, `video_cover`, `video`, `render_output`, and `capture`.
- Add a user/workspace-scoped global asset library record for reusable images/videos, plus project-level attachment/usage records so the same understood asset can be reused in future projects without duplicating media.
- Support assets from manual upload, app capture, generated assets, render outputs, and imported social videos already registered as project assets.
- Add project-scoped async understanding jobs with retryable statuses.
- Extract deterministic media metadata before AI analysis: MIME type, duration, dimensions, file size when available, representative frames/thumbnails, and optional audio track presence.
- Store normalized AI tags, user-accepted tags, rejected tags, scene segments, suggested placements, confidence scores, summary, and provider metadata.
- Store source attribution fields for third-party/social media: platform, original URL, creator handle/name, credit text, imported URL, rights/reuse status, and notes.
- Add recommendation API for a content/video brief that returns ranked project assets and, when explicitly allowed, candidate global-library assets with fit reasons.
- Add provider credential resolution supporting both user BYOK and platform/global credentials.
- Add configurable guardrails for video length, sampled duration, frame count, file size, concurrency, daily quotas, retry, timeout and provider-cost control.
- Add Flutter typed models/API methods and minimal picker/library display for suggested tags, accepted tags, understanding status, and recommendation warnings.
- Preserve the existing asset picker selection model; recommendations help choose assets but do not auto-select or auto-publish.

## Scope Out

- Building a public DAM, team marketplace, or external-facing media portal.
- Scraping or downloading social network content directly from arbitrary URLs.
- Proving copyright/licensing ownership automatically.
- Auto-publishing third-party assets without user/editor validation.
- Full video editing, trimming, rendering, Remotion scene assembly, or audio generation.
- Fine-tuning a custom video-understanding model.
- Face recognition, identity matching, biometric classification, or sensitive-person inference.
- Storing full OCR transcripts, full audio transcripts, or sampled frame images as durable user-facing metadata by default.
- Cross-user, cross-workspace, team-shared, or public asset recommendations unless a future brand/team library spec explicitly authorizes it.

## Constraints

- Extend the existing `project_assets` domain rather than creating a disconnected library: V1 may add a canonical global asset table, but project asset records remain the user-facing project attachment/selection surface.
- All analysis is scoped by `user_id` or workspace owner plus optional `project_id`; project recommendations may only read project assets plus explicitly allowed global-library assets owned by the same user/workspace.
- Provider credentials are server-side platform/global credentials or user BYOK credential references; raw keys are never stored in asset metadata, result metadata, logs, or API responses.
- Credential resolution order is user BYOK first, then platform/global key if enabled for the user/workspace, then `provider_not_configured`.
- Provider selection is an operator/configuration concern; app users see guided analysis states and recommendations, not raw model/provider controls.
- Imported social-media assets must carry attribution metadata before they can be recommended without a warning.
- Understanding results are probabilistic. UI copy must present AI tags as suggestions until user accepted.
- Long videos must be sampled or clipped with bounded cost/time. Do not send unbounded media to any provider.
- V1 default guardrails are configurable but must ship with safe defaults:
  - `ASSET_UNDERSTANDING_MAX_IMAGE_BYTES`: 25 MB.
  - `ASSET_UNDERSTANDING_MAX_SOURCE_VIDEO_BYTES`: 500 MB for local inspection; larger videos become `needs_trim`.
  - `ASSET_UNDERSTANDING_MAX_SOURCE_VIDEO_SECONDS`: 1800 seconds for local inspection; longer videos become `needs_trim`.
  - `ASSET_UNDERSTANDING_MAX_PROVIDER_VIDEO_SECONDS`: 90 seconds of sampled clips per job.
  - `ASSET_UNDERSTANDING_MAX_PROVIDER_FRAMES`: 180 frames per job.
  - `ASSET_UNDERSTANDING_MAX_PROVIDER_FPS`: 1 FPS, reduced automatically to stay under frame and sampled-duration caps.
  - `ASSET_UNDERSTANDING_MAX_AUDIO_SECONDS`: 120 seconds of sampled audio/transcription cues per job.
  - `ASSET_UNDERSTANDING_CONCURRENCY_PER_PROJECT`: 2 running jobs.
  - `ASSET_UNDERSTANDING_CONCURRENCY_PER_USER`: 4 running jobs.
  - `ASSET_UNDERSTANDING_DAILY_PLATFORM_QUOTA`: 100 images and 25 videos per user/day when using platform credentials.
  - `ASSET_UNDERSTANDING_DAILY_BYOK_QUOTA`: 250 images and 50 videos per user/day by default, still operator-configurable to protect infrastructure.
  - `ASSET_UNDERSTANDING_PROVIDER_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`: 120 for images and 600 for videos.
  - `ASSET_UNDERSTANDING_MAX_RETRIES`: 2 with exponential backoff and idempotency keys.
- Sensitive software-demo footage may contain PII, emails, tokens, or customer data. The analysis pipeline must minimize raw content retention.
- V1 is asynchronous. The asset detail response can show the latest result, but request paths must not block on full video analysis.

## Dependencies

- Existing backend asset router: `contentglowz_lab/api/routers/assets.py`.
- Existing project asset schemas: `contentglowz_lab/status/schemas.py` and `contentglowz_lab/api/models/status.py`.
- Existing status service and migrations: `contentglowz_lab/status/service.py`, `contentglowz_lab/status/db.py`.
- Existing or new provider credential settings service for user BYOK and platform/global provider keys.
- Existing Flutter asset models/API/provider/picker:
  - `contentglowz_app/lib/data/models/project_asset.dart`
  - `contentglowz_app/lib/data/services/api_service.dart`
  - `contentglowz_app/lib/providers/providers.dart`
  - `contentglowz_app/lib/presentation/widgets/project_asset_picker.dart`
- Existing capture flows:
  - `contentglowz_app/lib/presentation/screens/capture/capture_screen.dart`
  - `contentglowz_app/lib/data/models/capture_asset.dart`
- Media tooling: use proven tools such as `ffprobe`/`ffmpeg` for duration, frame extraction, audio extraction and thumbnail sampling. Reuse `contentglowz_lab/agents/reels/audio_extractor.py` patterns where appropriate.
- Fresh external docs checked:
  - Gemini API video understanding docs, last updated 2026-05-07: supports video inputs, audio+visual processing, timestamps, clipping and FPS customization. `fresh-docs checked`.
  - OpenAI Images/Vision docs, current 2026-05-13: supports image input analysis through vision-capable models. `fresh-docs checked`.
  - OpenAI Speech-to-text docs, current 2026-05-13: supports transcriptions/translations and current transcribe models with file limits. `fresh-docs checked`.

## Invariants

- Asset understanding belongs to one owned canonical global asset and may be referenced by multiple owned project attachments/usages.
- Project-level recommendation results must never include another user/workspace's global assets.
- A global-library candidate cannot be used in a project workflow until it is explicitly attached to that project or selected through an API path that creates the attachment atomically.
- AI tags never replace user-accepted tags without explicit action.
- Recommendation ranking must always include enough reason/warning metadata for the user to understand why an asset appeared.
- Third-party/social source attribution is preserved through analysis, recommendation and selection.
- Tombstoned/degraded/local-only assets cannot be recommended for publishable usage unless the response explicitly marks them unavailable/historical.
- Provider raw responses, base64 frames, and secrets are not exposed through API responses.
- Provider calls must be idempotent per asset/version/job request so replay or double-submit cannot create duplicate charged jobs beyond the configured retry policy.
- Existing asset list/detail/select/tombstone/restore behavior remains backward compatible.

## Links & Consequences

- `contentglowz_lab/status/db.py`: needs idempotent tables/indexes for canonical global assets, project asset attachments/usages, understanding jobs, results, tags, segments, quotas and recommendation events.
- `contentglowz_lab/status/service.py`: needs canonical asset upsert/link helpers, asset-understanding create/update/list helpers, quota checks and event recording.
- `contentglowz_lab/api/models/status.py`: needs request/response models for global assets, project attachments, analysis jobs, tags, segments, attribution, credential source, quotas and recommendations.
- `contentglowz_lab/api/routers/assets.py`: needs endpoints under `/api/projects/{project_id}/assets/{asset_id}/understanding` and `/api/projects/{project_id}/assets/recommend`.
- `contentglowz_lab/api/services/*`: needs an analyzer service with provider adapters, credential resolution, guardrail enforcement and deterministic media extraction.
- `contentglowz_app/lib/data/models/project_asset.dart`: needs typed understanding metadata or dedicated models.
- `contentglowz_app/lib/data/services/api_service.dart`: needs typed calls for queue/status/accept-tags/recommendations.
- `contentglowz_app/lib/providers/providers.dart`: needs state methods that avoid stale active-project updates, following the existing asset-library guard pattern.
- `contentglowz_app/lib/presentation/widgets/project_asset_picker.dart`: can show AI tag chips, accepted tags, confidence, fit reasons and credit warnings.
- Docs: backend README and app support copy must distinguish "AI suggested tags" from user-confirmed tags, explain global-vs-project library behavior, document BYOK/platform credential resolution, quotas and legal rights.

## Documentation Coherence

- Update `contentglowz_lab/README.md` with asset understanding setup, provider env/BYOK requirements, job behavior, retention and attribution rules.
- Update app docs or support copy when the picker starts showing AI tags/recommendations.
- Add operational notes for ffmpeg availability, provider cost/time limits, default guardrail env vars, BYOK/platform credential precedence and quota behavior.
- Add a short privacy note: software-demo video analysis may contain sensitive screen content; raw frames/OCR should not be stored as durable metadata.
- Changelog should describe this as asset understanding/tagging, not as guaranteed semantic search or automatic copyright clearance.

## Edge Cases

- A waterfall/animal/cascade clip is visually relevant to a martial-arts video but has no legal permission metadata.
- A global-library asset is relevant to a new project but is not yet attached to that project.
- A software demo shows a signup flow but also includes private email/token text.
- A fast-moving short video changes scenes faster than 1 FPS sampling can capture.
- A long imported video exceeds provider upload limits and needs clipping/sampling.
- A silent video still needs visual understanding.
- An audio-only or music asset is present in the asset library but outside this visual understanding V1.
- An asset is re-analyzed after the user edited tags; user tags must not be overwritten.
- Provider returns plausible but wrong labels; low-confidence or user-rejected tags should not dominate recommendations.
- Imported source URL expires or is removed, but the durable asset remains in Bunny.
- Same visual appears as multiple assets; V1 may not dedupe unless metadata hash exists.
- A user clicks re-analyze repeatedly or two ingestion paths schedule the same asset simultaneously; idempotency and concurrency controls must prevent duplicate active provider jobs.
- A user BYOK key fails after the platform key is available; the failure must be attributed to the chosen credential source and must not silently charge the platform key unless fallback is explicitly allowed by configuration.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] CA 1: Given an owned image asset, when analysis is queued, then the API returns a user/workspace-scoped canonical asset, optional project attachment, queued job and no cross-user/workspace data.
- [ ] CA 2: Given an owned video asset, when analysis completes, then the result includes video-level tags and at least one timestamped scene segment when the provider returns segmentable content.
- [ ] CA 3: Given an asset has no configured analyzer provider, when analysis is requested, then the asset remains usable and the job exposes `provider_not_configured` without fake tags.
- [ ] CA 3a: Given both user BYOK and platform credentials are configured, when analysis runs, then the job records `credential_source=user_byok`; given user BYOK is absent and platform fallback is enabled, then it records `credential_source=platform`.
- [ ] CA 4: Given a social/imported asset has creator attribution, when it is recommended, then the response includes credit text and source metadata.
- [ ] CA 5: Given a social/imported asset lacks known permission, when it is recommended, then `rights_status=unknown` and `credit_required=true` are visible.
- [ ] CA 6: Given a kung-fu content brief and a deer-jumping video tagged as animal/motion/jump/nature, when recommendations run, then that asset can rank as `illustration` or `b_roll` with a fit reason and attribution warning.
- [ ] CA 6a: Given the deer-jumping video exists only in the user's global library, when project recommendations run with `include_global_candidates=true`, then it can appear as `candidate_global_asset` and must require explicit project attachment before publishable use.
- [ ] CA 7: Given a software signup recording, when analysis succeeds, then tags may include high-level concepts such as `software_demo`, `signup_flow`, `form`, or `dashboard` without storing full OCR text.
- [ ] CA 8: Given AI tags are low-confidence, when the app renders them, then they appear as suggestions and do not become accepted tags automatically.
- [ ] CA 9: Given the user accepts, edits, or rejects a tag, when the asset is re-analyzed, then user decisions remain preserved.
- [ ] CA 10: Given a tombstoned, degraded, local-only, or missing-storage asset, when recommendations run, then it is excluded or clearly marked unavailable according to existing eligibility rules.
- [ ] CA 11: Given a foreign project asset ID, when any understanding/status/recommendation/tag action is attempted, then the API returns 403/404 and writes no job/result.
- [ ] CA 12: Given provider output includes raw base64 frames, raw transcripts, prompt text or unexpected payloads, when normalized, then only allowed safe fields are persisted.
- [ ] CA 13: Given the active project changes in Flutter during a recommendation/tag mutation, when the response returns, then state is not applied to the new project context.
- [ ] CA 14: Given existing asset library list/detail/select flows are used, when understanding is added, then previous response contracts remain backward compatible.
- [ ] CA 15: Given a video exceeds configured duration, file-size, sampled-duration, frame-count or quota guardrails, when analysis is requested, then no provider call is made and the job exposes `needs_trim`, `skipped_limit_exceeded` or `quota_exceeded`.
- [ ] CA 16: Given duplicate analysis requests for the same asset/version arrive concurrently, when jobs are queued, then at most one active provider job is created and other requests reuse the existing job/status.

## Test Strategy

- Python schema tests for understanding models, confidence bounds, attribution enums and response serialization.
- Python migration/service tests for job/result/tag/segment persistence and indexes.
- Mocked provider tests for video timeline, image tags, invalid provider JSON, timeout, rate limit, provider_not_configured and unsafe payload stripping.
- Route tests for ownership, queued analysis, status reads, tag accept/reject, global-asset attachment, recommendations and attribution warnings.
- Quota/guardrail tests for max bytes, duration, frame count, sampled seconds, provider timeout, retry count, duplicate submission, per-project concurrency, per-user concurrency and daily platform/BYOK quota.
- Credential-resolution tests for user BYOK precedence, platform fallback, disabled fallback, missing provider and no secret leakage in errors/log-like payloads.
- Recommendation ranking tests with controlled asset fixtures: SaaS demo, waterfall, deer jump, martial arts, generic abstract background.
- Flutter Dart model tests for parsing understanding/recommendation payloads.
- Flutter provider tests for project-stale guards and error states.
- Flutter widget tests for suggested tags, accepted tags, confidence warnings and credit warnings in the picker.
- Manual smoke: add/import one software demo video and one eye-catching nature/social clip, run analysis, request recommendations for a content/video brief, verify tags/reasons/warnings.

## Risks

- Provider quality risk: video understanding can miss fast actions, hallucinate labels or overstate relevance. Mitigation: confidence scores, suggested-vs-accepted tags, user reject/edit controls and no auto-publish.
- Legal risk: social media footage may require permission beyond credit. Mitigation: preserve attribution, show unknown-rights warnings, never infer legal clearance.
- Privacy risk: software demos can contain emails, tokens or customer data. Mitigation: avoid durable raw OCR/transcript/frame storage by default, redact provider metadata, project-scope all reads.
- Cost/performance risk: long videos are expensive. Mitigation: async jobs, sampling, clipping, size limits, provider timeouts and retry/backoff.
- Data-model risk: JSON-only metadata would be hard to search and project-only assets would block future reuse. Mitigation: canonical global asset records, project attachments/usages, normalized tag/segment tables plus summary metadata on assets.
- Product risk: users may trust AI tags too much. Mitigation: UI labels suggestions clearly and keeps accepted user tags separate.
- Implementation risk: provider exploration may choose a different first adapter. Mitigation: keep analyzer interface provider-neutral and Gemini-compatible adapter replaceable.

## Execution Notes

- Read first:
  - `contentglowz_lab/api/routers/assets.py`
  - `contentglowz_lab/status/schemas.py`
  - `contentglowz_lab/status/service.py`
  - `contentglowz_lab/status/db.py`
  - `contentglowz_app/lib/data/models/project_asset.dart`
  - `contentglowz_app/lib/data/services/api_service.dart`
  - `contentglowz_app/lib/providers/providers.dart`
  - `contentglowz_app/lib/presentation/widgets/project_asset_picker.dart`
  - `contentglowz_lab/agents/reels/audio_extractor.py`
- Implement backend data contract before provider calls.
- Implement global asset identity and project attachment semantics before recommendation ranking. A project recommendation must be able to distinguish `attached_project_asset` from `candidate_global_asset`.
- Implement credential resolution and guardrail enforcement before the Gemini-compatible adapter can call any external provider.
- Keep analyzer prompts structured and require JSON output. Normalize and validate every provider response before persistence.
- Use one video per provider request when possible; for long/fast videos prefer representative clips or configurable FPS rather than full unbounded upload. The V1 defaults are 500 MB/1800 seconds max source inspection, 90 seconds sampled provider video, 180 frames, 1 FPS cap, 120 seconds sampled audio, 2 running jobs per project, 4 running jobs per user, 100 images plus 25 videos per user/day on platform credentials, 250 images plus 50 videos per user/day on BYOK, 120s image provider timeout, 600s video provider timeout, and 2 retries.
- Do not add broad social scraping. Imported social clips must already exist as project assets with attribution metadata.
- Do not expose provider model, FPS, clipping or safety controls in the app UI during V1.
- Stop and reroute if implementation needs a full rights-management system, cross-user/team libraries, social download/scraping, Remotion render integration, or unbounded provider analysis.
- Suggested validation commands:
  - `python3 -m pytest contentglowz_lab/tests/test_asset_understanding*.py contentglowz_lab/tests/test_project_assets*.py`
  - `python3 -m py_compile contentglowz_lab/api/services/asset_understanding.py contentglowz_lab/api/services/asset_media_inspection.py`
  - `flutter test test/data/project_asset_test.dart test/providers/project_asset_provider_test.dart test/presentation/project_asset_picker_test.dart`
  - `flutter analyze lib/data/models/project_asset.dart lib/data/services/api_service.dart lib/providers/providers.dart lib/presentation/widgets/project_asset_picker.dart`

## Open Questions

None for the product/data contract. Provider market selection remains a separate exploration for long-term optimization, but V1 implementation is defined as provider-neutral with a Gemini-compatible adapter path, user BYOK plus platform/global credential support, and explicit guardrails for cost, privacy, concurrency and quota.
