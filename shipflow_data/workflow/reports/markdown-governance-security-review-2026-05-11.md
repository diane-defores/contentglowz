Date: 2026-05-11
Project: contentflow

Command run:

```bash
rg -n -i "api[_-]?key|token|secret|password|bearer|authorization|cookie|private|localhost|supabase|service[_-]?role|webhook|client_secret" . -g '*.md' -g '!contentflowz/**' -g '!node_modules/**' -g '!contentglowz_site/node_modules/**'
```

## Scope Reviewed

- `shipflow_data/workflow/specs`
- `shipflow_data/workflow/bugs`
- `shipflow_data/workflow/research`
- `shipflow_data/workflow/explorations`
- `shipflow_data/workflow/qa`
- `shipflow_data/workflow/reports`

## Findings

- No files in-scope were found to contain concrete secret values that needed redaction before migration.
- Matches were present only as:
  - placeholder names (e.g., `ZERNIO_API_KEY`, `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`, `FIRECRAWL_API_KEY`),
  - operational policy language (`no secrets in logs`, `app-private temporary files`, etc.),
  - non-sensitive references to OAuth/authorization concepts.
- No in-scope file was blocked as `blocked-security-review`.

## Security Decisions Logged

- `blocked-security-review`: **0**
- `blocked-classification`: **0** (all files classified and migrated as workflow artifacts)
- `redaction-required`: **0**

## Notes

- The migration retained policy language and placeholders, and did not copy any literal credentials or raw private logs into canonical workflow artifacts.
