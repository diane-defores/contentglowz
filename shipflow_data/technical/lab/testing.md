# Testing

## Purpose

Document the durable testing contract for `lab` after migrating stale local test documentation out of `lab/tests/README.md`.

## Owned Files

- `tests/`
- `pytest.ini`
- `requirements-dev.lock`
- local helper scripts that invoke pytest for backend validation

## Entrypoints

- `python -m pytest`
- `uv run --no-project --python 3.12 --with-requirements requirements-dev.lock python -m pytest`

## Invariants

- `lab` testing truth comes from the current test tree and commands, not from historical migration-status prose.
- Claims like pass counts, migration completion, or category coverage must not live in durable docs unless they are regenerated and kept current.
- Live API or provider-dependent checks must be labeled as conditional or optional.

## Validation

- Confirm `pytest.ini` still matches the current test layout.
- Confirm command examples run against the current dependency lockfiles.
- If new durable test categories are introduced, update this file and `shipflow_data/technical/lab/README.md`.

## Reader Checklist

- Read this file before changing test layout, test invocation guidance, or backend validation expectations.
- Prefer code and current test commands over historical summaries.

## Maintenance Rule

Keep this file limited to stable testing contracts. Put execution history in QA trackers, not here.
