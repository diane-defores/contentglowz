# Technical Docs

This directory maps code areas that need durable technical context before future ShipFlow edits.

Start with `code-docs-map.md`. Load only the mapped module context for the files being changed.

## Current Coverage

- `ai-runtime-and-url-safety.md`: PydanticAI adapter, BYOK OpenRouter key resolution, repo understanding synthesis, and URL safety for Exa/Firecrawl.
- `agent-pipelines.md`: durable boundary for historical `agents/*` local READMEs and current pipeline documentation ownership.
- `backend-runtime-and-product-apis.md`: backend runtime notes, public/product API contracts, project intelligence, asset library, video timeline, render artifacts, GSC OAuth, image generation, and project selection.
- `testing.md`: stable backend testing contract and migration target for stale local test-framework prose.
- `../platforms/crewai.md`: CrewAI version policy, request-scoped LLM routing, agent/tool boundaries, structured outputs, and migration risks for `lab`.

## Maintenance Rule

Update this index and `code-docs-map.md` when a new backend subsystem gets a technical module context or when mapped files move.
