# Agent Pipelines

## Purpose

Capture the durable documentation boundary for historical `agents/*` local READMEs that were previously acting as pseudo-canonical architecture docs.

## Owned Files

- `agents/seo/`
- `agents/scheduler/`
- related pipeline entrypoints under `agents/`

## Entrypoints

- backend route and service calls that dispatch SEO or scheduler workflows
- module imports under `agents/seo/*` and `agents/scheduler/*`

## Invariants

- Canonical architecture truth belongs in `shipflow_data/technical/lab/architecture.md` and related technical docs, not in long local feature READMEs under `lab/agents/*`.
- Historical claims about agent counts, specific models, phases, or completion status are unstable and must be treated as migration input unless proven by current code.
- Scheduler and image subsystems may be deterministic pipelines even when older docs describe them as "agents". Prefer current code semantics over historical naming.

## Validation

- When workflow architecture changes, update `shipflow_data/technical/lab/architecture.md` first.
- Reduce local `agents/*/README.md` files to lightweight pointers unless they are required by a runtime or packaging contract.
- Avoid copy-pasting capability matrices into multiple files.

## Reader Checklist

- Read this file when a task touches agent orchestration docs or historical agent READMEs.
- Cross-check with `shipflow_data/technical/lab/architecture.md` before trusting older prose.

## Maintenance Rule

Keep durable workflow documentation in `shipflow_data/technical/lab/`. Local README files under `agents/` should remain compatibility façades only.
