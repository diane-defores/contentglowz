# Content Quality Scoring

Know exactly how readable your content is before it goes live. Content Quality Scoring runs 6 industry-standard readability metrics on every article and gives you a clear quality grade — so you publish content that ranks *and* reads well.

---

## Why Readability Matters for SEO

### The Problem

You can nail every SEO checkbox — keywords, schema markup, internal links — and still fail if readers bounce after 10 seconds. Google measures dwell time and engagement. If your content is too complex, visitors leave and your rankings drop.

The uncomfortable truth:

- The average web reader has an **8th-grade reading level**
- Content written above 10th grade loses **40-60% of readers**
- Most SEO tools check keyword density but ignore readability entirely

### The Solution

Content Quality Scoring acts as your automated editor. It checks every piece of content against proven readability formulas and flags issues *before* publication — not after your bounce rate tells you something's wrong.

## Metrics We Track

### 6 Industry-Standard Scores

| Metric | What It Measures | Target for Web Content |
|--------|-----------------|----------------------|
| **Flesch Reading Ease** | Overall readability (0-100, higher = easier) | 60-70 (8th-9th grade) |
| **Flesch-Kincaid Grade** | US school grade level needed to understand | 7-9 |
| **Gunning Fog Index** | Years of formal education needed | 8-12 |
| **SMOG Index** | Education years needed (based on polysyllables) | 8-10 |
| **Coleman-Liau Index** | Grade level based on characters per word | 8-10 |
| **Reading Time** | Estimated time to read the full article | Varies |

### Quality Grade

Every article gets a letter grade based on a composite analysis:

| Grade | Meaning | Action |
|-------|---------|--------|
| **A** | Excellent — clear, well-structured, right complexity | Publish |
| **B** | Good — minor improvements possible | Publish with optional tweaks |
| **C** | Fair — some sections too complex or too simple | Review flagged sections |
| **D** | Needs work — significant readability issues | Rewrite before publishing |
| **F** | Major issues — likely to lose readers | Rewrite required |

### Automated Issue Detection

The scorer flags specific problems:

- **"Flesch score 42 — too difficult for web content"** — sentences are too long or words too complex
- **"Average sentence length too high"** — break up long sentences
- **"Word count below minimum"** — article may be too thin for SEO

## How It Works

### Built Into the Pipeline

Content Quality Scoring runs automatically during content generation. The SEO robot's Editor agent checks readability as part of quality control — before the article reaches your repository.

```
Research → Write → Optimize → Quality Check → Publish
                                    ↑
                            Readability scoring
                            happens here
```

### Real Example

Here's what a quality check returns for a blog article:

```json
{
  "word_count": 1847,
  "sentence_count": 92,
  "paragraph_count": 24,
  "avg_sentence_length": 20.1,
  "flesch_reading_ease": 64.2,
  "flesch_kincaid_grade": 8.3,
  "gunning_fog": 10.1,
  "smog_index": 9.4,
  "coleman_liau": 9.8,
  "reading_time_sec": 442,
  "readability_level": "8th-9th grade (standard)",
  "quality_grade": "A",
  "issues": []
}
```

This article scores an A: 8th-9th grade reading level, 20-word average sentence length, and no flagged issues. Ready to publish.

### Compare: Good vs. Bad

| Metric | Good Article | Bad Article |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| Flesch Reading Ease | 64.2 | 38.5 |
| Flesch-Kincaid Grade | 8.3 | 14.1 |
| Avg Sentence Length | 20.1 | 31.4 |
| Quality Grade | A | D |
| Reader Impact | Readers stay, engage, share | Readers bounce in 15 seconds |

## Use Cases

### Pre-Publication Gate

Set a minimum quality threshold for your content pipeline. Articles scoring below C get flagged for human review before publishing.

### Content Auditing

Run quality scoring on your existing articles to find which ones need rewriting:

```bash
# Score an existing article
curl -X POST https://api.contentflow.com/api/content/{id}/readability \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
```

### A/B Testing Readability

Create two versions of an article at different reading levels and compare engagement metrics. Most teams find that dropping 2 grade levels increases time-on-page by 20-30%.

### Writer Feedback

Give your content team objective feedback. Instead of subjective "this feels too dense", you can say "Gunning Fog is 14.2 — we need it under 12."

## The Sweet Spot

Based on analysis of top-performing SEO content:

```
                    TOO SIMPLE                SWEET SPOT              TOO COMPLEX
                    ◄──────────►             ◄──────────►            ◄──────────►
Flesch Score:       80+                      60-70                    <50
Grade Level:        5th grade                8th-9th grade            College+
Reader Feel:        "This is obvious"        "Clear and helpful"      "I need a dictionary"
SEO Impact:         Thin content penalty     Maximum engagement       High bounce rate
```

Target the sweet spot: complex enough to demonstrate expertise, simple enough that anyone can follow.
