# AGENT - app

## Canonical file policy

`app/AGENT.md` remains a local compatibility contract.
Canonical technical truth for `app` lives under `shipflow_data/technical/app/`.

## Mission

Keep `app` as the Flutter product application for ContentGlowz while preserving the app, backend, and auth contracts documented in `shipflow_data`.

## Canonical sources

- `shipflow_data/technical/app/README.md`
- `shipflow_data/technical/app/context.md`
- `shipflow_data/technical/app/context-function-tree.md`
- `shipflow_data/technical/app/architecture.md`
- `shipflow_data/technical/app/guidelines.md`
- `shipflow_data/workflow/app/TASKS.md`

## Invariants

- Do not expand local facade docs with durable architecture or product detail.
- Keep Flutter access, auth, offline queue, and API behavior aligned with canonical `shipflow_data/technical/app/*` docs.
- If app routing, auth, offline replay, publish, capture, or API contract behavior changes, update the relevant `shipflow_data` artifact first.

## Validation

- Use the focused Flutter checks required by the changed surface.
- Preserve the ARM64 Android release guardrail from canonical technical docs.
