# CLAUDE.md

## Project Overview

`app` is the Flutter product application for ContentGlowz.

## Canonical References

- `shipglowz_data/technical/app/README.md`
- `shipglowz_data/technical/app/architecture.md`
- `shipglowz_data/technical/app/context.md`
- `shipglowz_data/workflow/app/TASKS.md`
- `shipglowz_data/workflow/app/AUDIT_LOG.md`

## Common Commands

```bash
./build.sh --serve
./pm2-web.sh
./scripts/validate-clerk-runtime.sh
```

## Operating Rules

- Keep local docs short and defer durable truth to `shipglowz_data`.
- Update canonical docs when routing, auth, offline replay, publish, capture, or API contract behavior changes.
- Before manual QA, run the strongest local Flutter checks that match the changed surface.
