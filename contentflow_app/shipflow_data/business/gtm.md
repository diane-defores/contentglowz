# Go-to-Market Context — contentflow_app

## Public promise
ContentFlow App is a practical operator interface for creators and lean teams who want to move from idea to publish-ready content with less tooling friction and stronger continuity. It does **not** claim complete automation; it claims controlled, traceable execution backed by human review and resilient workflows.

## Primary segment
- **Primary:** creators, solopreneurs, founders, and small content teams.
- **Buying pattern:** teams that already use multiple tools and need one authenticated workspace to reduce switching overhead.
- **Behavioral signal:** prefer reliability and continuity over raw feature count, especially during backend instability.

## Offer shape
- A production Flutter shell tied to FastAPI for planning, review, and scheduling operations.
- Human-in-the-loop content control (`editor`, `feed`, `review/status`, `drip`, `calendar`) instead of opaque fully-automatic publishing.
- Resilient operations through local cache and offline queueing for supported mutations.

## Channels currently documented in repo
- **Direct usage / onboarding channel:** web auth handoff paths under `APP_WEB_URL` + `web_auth/*` (`/sign-in`, `/sign-up`, `/sso-callback`).
- **Supportive conversion surface:** in-repo documentation (`README.md`) and setup scripts that are reused for installation + validation.
- **Cross-surface referral channel:** ecosystem references to `contentflow_site` for acquisition and positioning (external to this repo).

## Proof points (supported in code/docs)
- End-to-end auth path and gated routing are documented and implemented for app entry.
- Multi-project workspace flow exists in app navigation and state providers.
- Offline/ degraded mode is explicitly implemented and documented as a product quality mechanism.
- Feedback admin and admin gate are present (email allowlist path, separate admin screen).

## GTM objections and prepared responses
- **"Can I publish everywhere today?"**
  - Partial answer: publish-related screens and settings exist, but the complete account-mapping and external publish feedback loop is still marked incomplete in current specs.
- **"Is this production-ready?"**
  - The app is operational for authenticated planning/review workflows, with explicit degraded-mode behavior under API failure; this supports continuity claims while reserving full publish parity for later phases.
- **"Is AI fully autonomous?"**
  - No. The documented positioning is explicit: assistant + human review.
- **"Can this break existing channels?"**
  - Route and auth behavior are centralized; integration changes should be validated through specs and docs before changes are promoted.

## Market readiness caveat
Given the current state, messaging should prioritize reliability, workflow continuity, and human review depth first, and avoid hard promises about complete publication automation or billing outcomes.
