# Product Context — contentflow_app

## Position
`contentflow_app` is the authenticated Flutter execution layer of the ContentFlow ecosystem. It is the operator-facing app that turns source inputs (ideas, project context, personas, rituals) into reviewable, schedulable content output while tolerating API instability.

## What this product does now
- provides authenticated onboarding and workspace bootstrap via Clerk + FastAPI session flow;
- supports multi-project workspace management with an explicit active-project selection model;
- runs content workflows (feed, ideas, angles, editor, personas, scheduling, drip plans, affiliation/content domains);
- captures local Android screenshots and screen recordings for creator reference assets;
- supports production-adjacent resilience through degraded mode (cached reads + queued writes + replay + sync state)
- exposes diagnostics and observability (`/uptime`, `/performance`, `/analytics`, `/activity`) so operators understand backend and queue health;
- supports feedback capture (text/audio) and admin review for support triage.

## Core user journey
1. user signs in through Clerk web auth pages and lands on `/entry`;
2. bootstrap checks evaluate auth, API availability, and workspace state;
3. user either completes onboarding, resumes from cached state, or navigates to a project/workflow screen;
4. workflow actions are executed against FastAPI and reflected in the app shell;
5. if API is unavailable, supported actions are queued and replayed when connectivity returns.

## Product boundaries (what is currently documented and delivered)
- **In scope:** human-in-the-loop review/publish preparation, project configuration, content status, offline continuity, and workflow surfaces.
- **Android-only V1 scope:** local device screenshot and screen-recording capture with Android consent, app-scoped storage, preview, discard, and share/export.
- **Partially in scope / not finished:** end-to-end external publish execution by channel.
  - Route and UX for publish actions exists in some paths, but full channel-account linking and feedback loop are not fully closed yet.
- **Explicitly out of scope in this repo:** marketing site, public SEO/landing content, pricing mechanics, and full AI orchestration decisions (owned by surrounding repos and services).

## Proven functional domains
- Entry and access control (`/entry`, `/auth`, `/onboarding`, route guards).
- Structured workflows: `Projects`, `Feed`, `Editor`, `Persona`, `Ideas`, `Angles`, `Drip`, `Research`, `Ritual`.
- Operational domains: `Affiliations`, `SEO`, `Runs`, `Newsletter`, `Templates`, `Content Tools`, `Calendar`, `History`, `Activity`.
- Settings and integrations surfaces (`/settings`, `/settings/integrations`).

## Non-goals (explicitly maintained)
- Not positioned as a fully autonomous publishing factory.
- Not responsible for marketing pages or external campaign channel management.
- Not a native-auth-first mobile rewrite yet (web auth path is the active production path in this repo).
- Not a cloud screen-recording asset library yet; capture uploads, retention, and sync need a separate backend spec.

## Business-facing constraints to keep synchronized
- The app depends on consistent workspace/project semantics from backend contracts.
- Any change to onboarding, publish behavior, or offline coverage changes this product promise and must trigger docs updates for user-facing claims.
